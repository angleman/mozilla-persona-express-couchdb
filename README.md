# Persona Example App

Built on the shoulder of giants

 - [Mozilla Persona](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Persona)
 - [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) hosted at [Cloudant](https://cloudant.com/)
 - [nano](https://github.com/dscape/nano)
 - [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
 - [Request](https://github.com/mikeal/request)
 - [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
 - [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)

## Demo

Visit [mysterious-coast-9759.herokuapp.com](http://mysterious-coast-9759.herokuapp.com/) to see the app in action.
It might take some time to load as it is running on the free dyno.
 
## Other examples

Take a look at these other resources. They were the foundation and inspiration for my own project. Without them I couldn't have done it! Therefore, thank you!

 - [123done](https://github.com/mozilla/123done)
 - [node.js-persona-example](https://github.com/lloyd/node.js-persona-example)
 - [myfavoritebeer.org](https://github.com/lloyd/myfavoritebeer.org)
 - [browserid-cookbook](https://github.com/mozilla/browserid-cookbook/tree/master/node-express)

However, all of the examples were missing some features I'd like to see. These are

 - proper DB implementation
 - CSRF protection
 - Content Security Policy (CSP)
 - avoid global variables
 - use of request module (imho makes code easier to read)
 - simplicity

I tried to take the best features from the examples to create my own app.

I'm sure my example can be improved as well. So if there is anything wrong or you see room for improvements, please open an [issue](https://github.com/zeMirco/mozilla-persona-express-couchdb/issues).
 
## Test

Coming soon ...
